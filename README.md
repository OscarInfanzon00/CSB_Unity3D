### Users Collection
Each document represents a user with fields:
- `avatarURL` (string)
- `email` (string)
- `userID` (string)
- `userLevel` (int)
- `username` (string)
- `wordsTyped` (int)

### Rooms Collection
Each document represents a game room with fields:
- `creatorID` (string)
- `isGameStarted` (boolean)
- `players` (array of objects: `{userID, username}`)
- `roomId` (string)

### Stories Collection
Each document represents a collaborative story with fields:
- `storyID` (string)
- `storyText` (string)
- `usernames` (array of usernames)
- `users` (array of userIDs)
- `wordsCount` (int)

### Friends Collection
Each document represents a user's friend list:
- Document ID is the user's `userID`
- `friends` (array of userIDs of friends)
